# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch
This project is an implementation of a neural network with two layers. Both layers are lined with sigmoid activation
functions. 

### Overview
The project has two files:

ANN.py: This file contains an implementation of a class for neural networks with two layers both lined with sigmoid
activations.
main.py: This file contains test data and examples. When executed plots of the training and loss will be made. Training
and test accuracies will be displayed in the terminal.
